    "2. A specific probability where the prediction changes from 0 to 1 class\n",

    "5. A dummy model is a model where the positive class is always predicted and serves as a baseline for how other models perform against this model, which is considered to be guessing.\n",
    "6. Class imbalance is when the positive and negative classes aren't around the same amount in the dataset. In this case it's something like a 73% imbalance.\n",
    "7. Accuracy is misleading when there is a class imbalance because we learned from the dummy model that you can be 73% accurate just by guessing due to the class imbalance. The class imbalance gives a false impression that the accuracy is properly earned.\n",
